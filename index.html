			<p class="intro"> On November 6th against the Milwaukee Bucks, Brooklyn Nets Guard Cam Thomas scored 45 points. It was the fifth time in his career he scored 40 or more points in a game. The 22 year-old had played just 2,363 career minutes before achieving this feat.

			<p>
                So far this season, Cam Thomas <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_per_game.html" target="_blank">ranks</a> 12th in points per game (26.9) among players who have played in at least 8 games (stats as of Nov. 29). Among the 11 players ranked ahead of him, how many career minutes did they play before scoring at least 40 points in 5 different games?

            <p>  “Cam Thomas is an exceptional scorer,” says Rob Mahoney, a Staff Writer who covers the NBA for The Ringer. “It’s not often that you’ll find players who are this explosive while managing to fly this far under the radar.”  </p>
